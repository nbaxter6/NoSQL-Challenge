# NoSQL-Challenge

This project was provided by EdX Data Analysis Bootcamp and completed by me with guidance from my course instructor Ali Lakhani. 

Project premise: Hired as a contractor by the editors of a food magazine to evaluate the food hygiene ratings data provided by the UK Food Standards Agency. This analysis will help food critics and journalists decide where to focus future articles. 

### Repository contents: 
- One jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of pymongo to import the database collection and prepare the data for analysis.
- Another jupyter notebook for the analysis of the data by several different metrics and converting those analyses into dataframes.
- Resources folder containing the establishments json file.
